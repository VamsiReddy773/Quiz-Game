# Quiz-Game
This project implements a simple Python quiz application with user accounts.
This is a Python-based interactive Quiz Game with user account creation, login functionality, and dynamic quiz management. The project allows users to create accounts, login securely, and take a quiz based on questions stored in a text file. The game keeps track of the userâ€™s score after each quiz session.

# Features:

User Account Management: Users can create an account with their name, username, gender, and password. The account details are stored securely in an SQLite database.

# Secure Login: 
Users can log in using their account number and password. Login credentials are validated against stored data in the database.

# Dynamic Quiz: 
The quiz questions are loaded from an external file (questions.txt), allowing easy modification of the quiz content. Each question comes with multiple-choice options, and the correct answer is tracked for scoring.

# Scoring System: 
Users' performance is evaluated based on the number of correct answers, and their final score is displayed at the end of the quiz.

Python 3.x
SQLite Database for storing user accounts and quiz data
Text File for storing quiz questions and options
